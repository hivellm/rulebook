3. Run quality checks before committing:
   - Type check / Compiler check
   - Linter (no warnings allowed)
   - All tests (100% pass rate)
   - Coverage check
4. Update docs/ when implementing features
5. Follow strict documentation structure
6. **NEVER run destructive deletions (`rm -rf`) in repositories generated from this template; always use `git submodule add` when a submodule is requested.**
