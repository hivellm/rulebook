## Context
The rulebook project needed significant enhancements to support modern development workflows. The existing tool was basic and lacked integration with AI tools, real-time monitoring, and sophisticated project management capabilities.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: 
  - Modern full-screen console interface
  - Autonomous agent workflow management
  - OpenSpec integration
  - Comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - 95%+ test coverage
- Non-Goals: 
  - Backward compatibility with old interfaces
  - Support for legacy Node.js versions
  - Complex configuration options

## Decisions
- Decision: Use blessed library for modern console interface
- Alternatives considered: 
  - ANSI escape codes (limited functionality)
  - Web-based interface (complexity)
  - Terminal UI libraries (blessed chosen for maturity)

- Decision: Implement OpenSpec workflow integration
- Alternatives considered:
  - Custom task management (OpenSpec provides standardization)
  - Simple JSON files (markdown provides better readability)

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Blessed dependency → Mitigation: Well-maintained library with good TypeScript support
- Complex UI → Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and error handling
- Performance impact → Mitigation: Efficient rendering and update strategies

## Migration Plan
1. Install new dependencies
2. Implement new modules
3. Update CLI commands
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation
6. Remove deprecated interfaces

## Open Questions
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Additional CLI tool integrations
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
