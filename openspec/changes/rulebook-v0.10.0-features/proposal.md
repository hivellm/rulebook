# Proposal: Rulebook v0.10.0 Advanced Features

## Why
The current rulebook tool lacks advanced features for modern development workflows including real-time monitoring, autonomous task management, and comprehensive project health tracking. Users need better integration with AI tools and more sophisticated project management capabilities.

## What Changes
- **ADDED** Modern full-screen console watcher with system monitoring
- **ADDED** Autonomous agent manager for CLI tool integration
- **ADDED** OpenSpec workflow integration with task management
- **ADDED** Persistent logging system with rotation
- **ADDED** Configuration manager with feature toggles
- **ADDED** CLI bridge for AI tool communication
- **ADDED** Comprehensive test coverage (95%+)
- **BREAKING** Removed classic ANSI watcher interface

## Impact
- Affected specs: Core functionality, CLI interface, project management
- Affected code: src/core/, src/cli/, tests/, package.json
- New dependencies: blessed, cli-cursor, ansi-escapes, execa, node-notifier, uuid
