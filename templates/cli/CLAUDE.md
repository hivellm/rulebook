# Claude API/CLI Rules

**Tool**: Anthropic Claude API with 200K context window

## Quick Start

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
# Use via API or compatible CLIs
```

## Usage

In API requests or CLI prompts, include:
```
"Follow these project standards from AGENTS.md:
[paste relevant AGENTS.md sections]

Implement [feature] with tests first (95%+ coverage)."
```

## Workflow

1. Include AGENTS.md content in system prompt or context
2. Request features with standards reference
3. Review generated code
4. Run quality checks

**Critical**: Claude has 200K context - paste full AGENTS.md for best results.
