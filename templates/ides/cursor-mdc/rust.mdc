# Rust Rules

See `/.rulebook/specs/RUST.md` for full requirements.

## Key Rules

- Prefer `Result<T, E>` over `unwrap()` / `expect()`
- Use `thiserror` for library errors, `anyhow` for application errors
- Minimize `clone()` — prefer borrows and lifetimes
- Use `clippy` with `#![deny(clippy::all)]`
- Document public API with `///` doc comments
- Prefer iterator adapters over manual loops

## Error Handling

- Propagate errors with `?` operator
- Define domain error enums with `thiserror`
- Never `panic!` in library code
