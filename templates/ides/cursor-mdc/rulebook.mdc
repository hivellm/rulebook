# Project Agent Directives

Generated by @hivehub/rulebook. See `.rulebook/specs/` for detailed specifications.

## Task Management

All tasks MUST follow the Rulebook task structure:

```
.rulebook/tasks/<task-id>/
├── proposal.md         # Why and what changes
├── tasks.md            # Simple checklist only
└── specs/<module>/spec.md  # Technical specs
```

- Use `rulebook task create` to create tasks
- `tasks.md` contains ONLY simple checklist items
- Technical details go in `specs/<module>/spec.md`
- NEVER create README.md or PROCESS.md in task directories

## Quality Gates

Before every commit:
- `npm run type-check` — TypeScript must compile
- `npm run lint` — Zero lint errors
- `npm test` — All tests must pass
- Coverage threshold must be met

## Spec References

- Core rules: `/.rulebook/specs/RULEBOOK.md`
- Quality enforcement: `/.rulebook/specs/QUALITY_ENFORCEMENT.md`
- Git workflow: `/.rulebook/specs/GIT.md`
