# Ralph Autonomous Loop

See `/.rulebook/specs/AGENT_AUTOMATION.md` for full directives.

## Ralph Commands

```bash
rulebook ralph init     # Initialize autonomous loop
rulebook ralph run      # Start iterating on tasks
rulebook ralph status   # Check progress
rulebook ralph pause    # Pause for manual intervention
rulebook ralph history  # View past iterations
```

## PRD Format

Ralph uses `.rulebook/ralph/prd.json` with `userStories[]`:

```json
{
  "id": "US-001",
  "title": "Story Title",
  "description": "What needs to be done",
  "acceptanceCriteria": ["Must compile", "Tests pass"],
  "passes": false
}
```

## Quality Gates

All 4 gates MUST pass per iteration:
- type-check ✓, lint ✓, tests ✓, coverage ✓

Failed gates mark the story `passes: false` for retry.
