# Quality Enforcement

See `/.rulebook/specs/QUALITY_ENFORCEMENT.md` for full requirements.

## Mandatory Quality Gates

Every change MUST pass all quality gates before merge:

1. **Type Check** — `npm run type-check` (zero TypeScript errors)
2. **Lint** — `npm run lint` (zero ESLint errors)
3. **Tests** — `npm test` (all tests pass)
4. **Coverage** — Meet configured threshold (default 75%)

## Code Standards

- No `any` types without explicit justification
- No unused variables or imports
- Error handling at system boundaries only
- No over-engineering: minimum complexity for the task
- No backwards-compatibility hacks for unused code
