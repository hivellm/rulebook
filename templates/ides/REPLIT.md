# Replit IDE Rules

**Tool**: Cloud IDE with Ghostwriter AI

## Quick Start

Replit Ghostwriter reads workspace files automatically.

## Usage

```bash
# In Ghostwriter chat:
"Follow @AGENTS.md. Implement [feature] with tests."

# Inline completions:
Accept/reject based on AGENTS.md standards
```

## Features

- **Ghostwriter Chat**: AI assistant
- **Inline Completions**: Code suggestions
- **Explain Code**: AI explanations
- **Generate Code**: Full implementations

## Workflow

1. Keep AGENTS.md in workspace (Ghostwriter reads it)
2. Reference `@AGENTS.md` in chat
3. Review suggestions
4. Run tests in Replit console

**Critical**: Ghostwriter has workspace context - AGENTS.md is automatically available.
