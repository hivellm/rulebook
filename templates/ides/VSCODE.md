# VS Code AI Extensions Rules

**IDE**: VS Code with Copilot, Cody, Continue, or other AI extensions

## Quick Start

VS Code reads:
- `.vscode/settings.json` (generated by `rulebook init`)
- `.vscode/copilot-instructions.md` (if Copilot enabled)

## Usage

```bash
# In any AI chat/extension:
"Follow @AGENTS.md. Implement [feature] with tests (95%+ coverage)."

# Keep AGENTS.md open for context
# Extensions will reference it automatically
```

## Supported Extensions

- GitHub Copilot
- Cody
- Continue
- Codeium
- Tabnine
- Amazon Q

## Workflow

1. Rulebook generates `.vscode/settings.json` and `copilot-instructions.md`
2. Keep AGENTS.md open in workspace
3. Reference `@AGENTS.md` in extension prompts
4. Extensions read workspace context automatically

**Critical**: Generated settings point extensions to AGENTS.md standards.
