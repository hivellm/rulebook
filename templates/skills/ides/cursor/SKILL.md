# Cursor IDE Rules

**IDE**: AI-first code editor with Agent mode and Composer

## Quick Start

Cursor automatically reads:
- `.cursorrules` (generated by `rulebook init`)
- `AGENTS.md` (via `@AGENTS.md` references)

## Usage

```bash
# In Cursor chat/composer:
"Follow @AGENTS.md. Implement [feature] with tests (95%+ coverage)."

# Agent mode (Ctrl+Shift+K):
Use for complex multi-file changes
Reference @AGENTS.md for standards

# Composer (Cmd+I):
Use for quick edits
Reference @AGENTS.md when needed
```

## Features

- **Auto-context**: Reads .cursorrules automatically
- **@ Mentions**: Use `@AGENTS.md` to include standards
- **Agent Mode**: Autonomous multi-step implementations
- **Composer**: Quick inline edits

## Workflow

1. Rulebook generates `.cursorrules` pointing to AGENTS.md
2. Use `@AGENTS.md` in prompts for explicit reference
3. Agent/Composer follows standards automatically
4. Review changes and run quality checks

**Critical**: `.cursorrules` ensures Cursor follows AGENTS.md by default.
