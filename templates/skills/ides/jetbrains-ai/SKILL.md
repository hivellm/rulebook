# JetBrains AI Assistant Rules

**IDEs**: IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, RustRover, Rider, CLion, PhpStorm

## Quick Start

JetBrains AI reads workspace files automatically.

## Usage

```bash
# In AI Assistant chat:
"Follow @AGENTS.md. Implement [feature] with tests (95%+ coverage)."

# Keep AGENTS.md open for AI to reference
```

## Features

- **AI Chat**: Full conversation mode
- **Inline Suggestions**: Context-aware completions
- **Refactoring**: AI-powered code improvements
- **Test Generation**: Automated test creation

## Workflow

1. Keep AGENTS.md open in editor
2. Use AI Chat with "@AGENTS.md" references
3. Review suggested changes
4. Run IDE quality checks (built-in linters, tests)

**Critical**: Keep AGENTS.md open for AI Assistant to include standards in context.
