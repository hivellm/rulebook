# Windsurf IDE Rules

**IDE**: AI-powered editor with Cascade AI and Flow State

## Quick Start

Windsurf reads:
- `.windsurfrules` (generated by `rulebook init`)
- AGENTS.md (when open in workspace)

## Usage

```bash
# In Windsurf chat:
"Follow @AGENTS.md. Implement [feature] with tests."

# Cascade AI:
Multi-file autonomous mode
Reference @AGENTS.md for standards

# Flow State:
Inline suggestions
Context-aware completions
```

## Workflow

1. Rulebook generates `.windsurfrules` → points to AGENTS.md
2. Keep AGENTS.md open in workspace
3. Use Cascade for complex tasks with `@AGENTS.md` references
4. Flow State provides inline suggestions

**Critical**: `.windsurfrules` ensures standards are followed automatically.
