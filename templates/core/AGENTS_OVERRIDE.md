# Project-Specific Overrides

This file contains project-specific directives that take precedence over the generated AGENTS.md.

Add your custom rules, team conventions, or project-specific context here.
This file is NEVER overwritten by `rulebook init` or `rulebook update`.

## Example Overrides

- **Preferred patterns**: Always use X pattern for Y
- **Team conventions**: Code reviews require 2 approvals
- **Project context**: This project targets Node.js 20+ only
- **Custom quality gates**: Run `npm run e2e` before merging
